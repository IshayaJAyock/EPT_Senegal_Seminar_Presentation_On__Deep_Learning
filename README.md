# EPT Senegal Seminar Presentation On Deep Learning.

In this Repository, we kept tract of files used and generated during a seminar presentation on   
Deep learning to final year students of the Ecole Polytechnique de Thi√®s (EPT), Senegal

# Part 1

This part gives an introduction on a simple code implementation of deep linearing algorthms.
The implementation was partition into for four(4) part.

1. Generating data randomly.
2. Using the boston housing dataset.
3. Using the Iris data set for the network.
4. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes.


# Part 2
This part gives a general overview of Deep learning implementation, its uses data from  
www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data to build the model which was a regression problem.
Also the we used different techiques to improve performance of the model. Such as increase the number   
neurons in each layer, adding more layers to the netwok. And using call backs parameter to record the history  
of various metric during the training .

# Part 3
This part gives an implementation of the model by adding droup layer  
to reduce overfitting in the model. Also we incooperated sklearn models by using   
Piplines the workflow.

# Part 4
This part gives an implementation of MLP.  
The dataset of interest is the Pima Indians Dataset.   
we used it to show how to Serialize our model to JSON and HDF5 to be used later   
to make predictions.

# Part 5
This part gives a general overview on how to to implement convolutional neujral network.
We used the inbuild dataset for the implemedntation whic was the MNIST dataset that   
was shipped along with Keras module.
